    <h1>Ma, I'm Sorry</h1>
    <p>Ma, I'm sorry. <br>
    For the moments I was quiet when I should’ve said, “I love you.”<br>
    For the times I didn’t reply… when all you wanted was to hear how I was.<br>
    For the missed calls, the unread messages, the days I let life sweep me away—while you were there, waiting.<br><br>

    I know it’s not just about answering a phone.<br>
    It’s about answering your heart.<br>
    And I’m sorry for the times I didn’t.<br><br>

    Sometimes it’s hard to explain how fast the world moves, how noise fills the spaces I should be using to talk to you—but none of that is an excuse.<br>
    Because if there’s one voice I should never let get drowned out, it’s yours.<br><br>

    I’m sorry for the moments I forgot how much you worry.<br>
    How every silence from me echoes louder in your chest.<br>
    How your mind rewrites quiet into fear—and still, you choose patience instead of anger.<br><br>

    I’m sorry for making you feel like I wasn’t thinking of you.<br>
    The truth is, I always am.<br>
    You are stitched into my every prayer, every moment I smile, every dream I chase.<br><br>

    And I know saying “sorry” isn’t magic.<br>
    It won’t undo the times I made you feel unheard, unneeded.<br>
    But I promise I am learning—to slow down, to show up, to answer when it matters.<br><br>

    Because you matter.<br>
    And I will spend forever trying to be the kind of child your love deserves.<br><br>

    Ma… I'm sorry for everything.<br><br>

    For the things I did that hurt you—even if I didn’t mean to.<br>
    For the things I didn’t do, that you silently hoped I would.<br>
    For the raised tones, the stubborn replies, the moments I walked away instead of leaning in.<br>
    For every time I made you feel like your love wasn’t enough—when in truth, it was more than I ever deserved.<br><br>

    I’m sorry for the burdens I added to the ones you already carried.<br>
    For the days you gave your all and I didn’t even say thank you.<br>
    For being too caught up in growing up, that I forgot you were growing tired.<br><br>

    I’m sorry for not always understanding.<br>
    For not seeing that behind your strength was a tired woman just trying to hold everything together.<br>
    And I’m sorry that sometimes, I didn’t make it easier for you—when all you’ve ever tried to do was make life easier for me.<br><br>

    Ma, for everything I said, everything I didn’t,<br>
    everything I did, and everything I failed to do—<br><br>

    I’m sorry.<br>
    And I love you more than words will ever be able to say.</p>
