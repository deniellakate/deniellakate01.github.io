    <h1>To the Heart That Raised Me</h1>
    <p>If I could gather all the words in the world, still, none would be enough to tell you how much you mean to me.<br><br>
    Because how do you even begin to describe someone who gave you everything… even when she had nothing left for herself?<br>
    How do you measure the love of a mother who chose her child’s happiness over her own, every single day?<br><br>

    Kumusta ka, Ma?<br>
    How are you—really—beneath the smiles you wear like armor?<br>
    How are you, besides the fact that you never grow tired of taking care of us… of me?<br>
    I wonder about that sometimes.<br><br>

    Because I know you're the kind of woman who gives her all without asking if she has enough left for herself.<br>
    And I just hope, even once in a while, the world gives you back even a fraction of what you've poured into it.<br><br>

    Science says a mother carries her child for 9 months.<br>
    But I don’t believe that.<br>
    Because even now, even as I stand on my own two feet, I still feel your arms around me...<br>
    In the way I feel safe for no reason, in the quiet comfort that follows me when I’m scared, in the warmth I carry even in the coldest places.<br>
    You never stopped carrying me, Mama. You just learned how to do it without your hands.<br><br>

    You’ve given me more than time, more than care, more than love.<br>
    You gave me your youth, your strength, your sleep, your dreams… so I could grow, breathe, live, and become someone.<br>
    And I didn’t always see it— not until life taught me what it costs to give, to sacrifice, to hold yourself together when the world is falling apart.<br><br>

    There is no poetry deep enough, no song strong enough, to capture the quiet, unnoticed, everyday ways you’ve saved me.<br>
    In your silence. In your patience. In your steady, unshakable love.<br><br>

    You are my mother. And no title—no award, no crown—could ever compare to that.<br>
    You are God’s greatest gift to me, wrapped not in ribbons, but in courage, scars, and relentless love.<br><br>

    You are in every part of me.<br>
    In my smile, because you taught me how to find joy even when life is hard.<br>
    In my voice, because you listened to me when no one else did.<br>
    In my dreams, because you told me I was capable, even when I doubted myself.<br>
    In my strength, because I watched you fight battles you never spoke of.<br>
    Every step I take, every word I speak—it all echoes with the love you raised me in.<br><br>

    And if life gave me a thousand chances to start again, I would still choose you, Mama. Every single time.<br>
    Because even in another life, I’d still want to come from your heart.<br><br>

    Maybe I haven’t said it enough. Maybe I still won’t say it perfectly.<br>
    But I mean this with everything I am:<br><br>

    In everything I do, in every dream I chase, I carry you.<br>
    Not as a memory—but as my strength, my guide, my home.<br><br>

    Your love is the foundation of who I am.<br>
    It is the voice that tells me to keep going. The compass that brings me back when I feel lost.<br>
    And no matter how far life takes me… I will always come back to the heart that raised me.<br><br>

    I may grow older, taller, stronger—<br>
    but I will always be your child.<br>
    Always your reason. Always your miracle.<br>
    Always, your greatest proof that your love built something beautiful.</p>
