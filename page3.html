    <h2>December 30, 2006</h2>
    <p>
      On this day, something beautiful began‚Äîmy story. I came into this world tiny, fragile, and unaware.  
      But from the very beginning, you were there, Ma. With your hands that held me and your voice that calmed me,
      you became my first home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up under the warmth of your love, shaped by your laughter, guided by your strength.  
      And even when I didn't understand the world, I understood that I was loved‚Äîbecause you never let me forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not just a gift‚Äîit's a reflection of the life you gave me, the lessons you taught me,  
      and the love that has carried me through every moment.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you, Mama, for choosing to be my mother‚Äîevery single day. ü•πüíù
    </p>
