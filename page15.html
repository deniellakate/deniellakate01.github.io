    <h1>Dear Mama,</h1>
    <p>
      I just graduated from Senior High—and now, I’m standing on the edge of something even bigger: college.
      And while I’m proud, excited, and hopeful…I’m also scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because things are about to get more complicated.
      Schedules tighter. Days longer. Life busier.
      There will be more things to do, more people to meet,
      and sometimes, I might forget to breathe—let alone answer a message, or call you when I should.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma, there will be days ahead when I might not come home early.
      Days when my phone stays silent—not because I forgot you,
      but because life got loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be moments when I’m so tired, I fall asleep without saying goodnight, or when I’m so caught up in school, in tasks, in the whirlwind of becoming…that I won’t say the things I should.
    </p>
    <p>
      But please know this: even if I miss a few texts, even if I come home late, even if my voice gets lost in the noise of chasing my dreams—you will never stop being the center of my world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in those moments,
      I need you to remember this:
    </p>
    <p>
      You are never unseen.
      You are never set aside.
      You are never unloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the silence, you are with me.
      Even in the distance, your love is what grounds me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every achievement I’ll reach, every goal I’ll touch, will always have your fingerprints on it.
      Because I carry your sacrifices in my every step.
      I walk into classrooms with the strength you gave me.
      I face new challenges with the bravery I saw in you every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      College will be a whole new journey.
      It will stretch me, change me, challenge me—but it will never erase where I came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I came from you, Mama.
      From your tears, your laughter, your whispered prayers, your hands that worked without rest so mine could hold a diploma.
    </p>
    <p>
      So even if I can’t always talk to you as much, please don’t think I’ve forgotten you nor am I angry at you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m just working hard…so that one day, I can give you even a piece of the life you gave up for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please don’t mistake my absence for neglect.
      Don’t let unanswered calls make you feel unwanted.
      It’s not that I don’t care—it’s that I’m trying to build something that you can be proud of.
      Something you deserve.
      A life that’s worthy of the sacrifices you made.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even if I don’t say it every day,
      even if I fail sometimes to show it the way you deserve—You are the constant in my ever-changing world.
    </p>
    <p>
      So whenever you start to wonder, whenever loneliness tries to whisper lies to you—remember this:
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m still your child.
      Still holding your lessons.
      Still drawing strength from your love.
    </p>
    <p>
      And nothing—not time, not distance, not the storms of life—can ever take that away.
    </p>
