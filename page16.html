    <h1>I Love You, Mama</h1>
    <p>
      I may not say it every day. I may not always find the perfect moment, or the perfect words. But if there's one truth I carry in every beat of my heart, it's this:
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you in the quiet mornings when your presence makes everything feel okay.
      I love you in the chaotic afternoons, when your voice is the calm in my storm.
      I love you in the silent nights, when your prayers wrap around me like a blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you when I succeed—because it’s your love that lifted me there.
      I love you when I fail—because it’s your arms that catch me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you not just for what you’ve done for me, but for who you are.
      A woman of strength. Of grace. Of unmatched love.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you for the way you see me. For the way you never gave up on me, even when I didn’t understand myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you in ways deeper than words. In ways time can’t touch. In ways that will echo in every part of the life I build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mama, you are my first love.
      And no matter how far I go, or how big this world becomes—I will always be your child.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you. Always and in all ways, forever.
    </p>
